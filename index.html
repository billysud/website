                <p>New graduate from UC San Diego in the field of Computer Science and Engineering, I am building this website to continue my learning. I want to learn more about Javascript and React and topics like networking with tools such as Python to automate tasks. I am looking for a role where I can utilize my software skills and continue to grow!</p>

                    <p>Web Application</p>
                    <p>An ElectronJS application that lets users who want to write music get organized. It comes with a custom file system and lets users upload an audio file and write notes in timestamps wherever in the file! I worked on blueprinting all the code and designing the struture and format of all the functions along with being the scrum master and assigning tasks for my group mates to complete each week. I was also in charge of the Miro planning and presentation boards we used to outline and showcase our plans. There is also extensive end-to-end and unit testing that is in this repository.</p>

                    <h3>SHA-256 hashing and Blockchain</h3>
                    <p>Embedded Software</p>
                    <p>A two part project where I wrote code that takes in any type of file smaller than 65KB and returns the SHA-256 hash of it. This was accomplished with techniques such as parallel computing and a finite state machine. The SHA-256 is a cryptographically safe algorithm that uses an known initial hash values and compresses the hashes and combines them with contents from the file. The second part of the project involved modifying the SHA-256 hasher to try 16 nonce values simultaneously to check to see if this fits the ending hash of the previous block to verify the blockchain. Due to academic integrity reasons this code is not public.  </p>

                    <h3>Huffman Compression and Decompression</h3>
                    <p>Script</p>
                    <p>A popular algorithm derived in the 50's that uses a similar approach to compressing a file by taking the most used elements of a file and prioritizing those elements for a short length. A Huffman tree was created and used here to take in an arbitrary file of any type and reduces the size of it. Then another Huffman tree would be used to decode the file into the original file. This means that using the UNIX command diff between the original file and the result of the compressed and then decompressed file should result in no output. </p>

                    <p>A tool I created to help me manage my daily tasks. It uses localstorage in the browser to keep track of task created on certain days. The app also has a live calander that jumps to the current date. It also was styled only using CSS but I'm thinking of using some React in the future!</p>
